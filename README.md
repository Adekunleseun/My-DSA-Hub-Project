# My-DSA-Hub-Project
My first exam project in DSA hub online class.
## MY AMAZON CASE STUDY:
I Started by cleaning the data first, then i created pivot table on a new sheet
then created multiple pivot tables for each question
some questions required to create new columns which i did and some required to group the data's and i did that too before refreshing the pivot table to update the new columns
then i start to create charts for all the questions accordingly, pasted them on new sheet and designed accordingly for colourful outlook
